# Inherent bias simulations

These simulations show the bias in the rerooting method to estimate the number of transitions on the correct tree and the posterior trees estimated with 1000 and 100 nucleotides.

The number of simulated transitions ranges from 2 to 35. Note that in small trees it is difficult to simulate large numbers of transitions.
