Test tree reconstruction with different numbers of sites
========================================================

To do: 

- Make function to simulate the sequence data for a tree with a given age, rate, number of transitions, and sequence length
  - age
  - number of taxa
  - rate
  - number of transitions
  - sequence length



Try tree reconstruction with 0, 10, 100, and 1000, with a rate of 0.1.
