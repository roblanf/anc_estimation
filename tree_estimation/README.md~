Test tree reconstruction with different numbers of sites
========================================================

To do: 

- ~~Make function to simulate the sequence data for a tree with a given age, rate, number of transitions, and sequence length~~
  - age
  - number of taxa
  - rate
  - number of transitions
  - sequence length

- Make function to take the output of get_tree_Q and make an xml file for beast 2

- Make function to run beast 2 and summarise the output:
  - HCC tree
  - ESS of key parameters
  - age of the root
  - others?



Try tree reconstruction with 0, 10, 100, and 1000, with a rate of 0.1.
